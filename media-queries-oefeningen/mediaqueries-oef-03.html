    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>

          In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him
          get around the royal gardens faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          The device know as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse") was made of wood,
          and propelled by pushing your feed on the ground in a gliding
          movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not seen a suitable for any place other than a well maintained
          pathway.

          In 1865, the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") attached pedals to the
          front wheel, but its wooden structure made it extremely uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. The pedals were attached
          directly to the front wheel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel
          provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor.
